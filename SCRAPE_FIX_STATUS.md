# Scrape Endpoint Fix Status

## Issue
The `/api/scrape` endpoint was returning 404 on Railway deployment.

## Root Cause
The Railway deployment was using `server/routes.js` which didn't have the `/api/scrape` endpoint defined.

## Fix Applied
Added the `/api/scrape` endpoint to `server/routes.js` (lines 237-285).

## Testing Results

### ✅ Localhost Development (Port 3001)
- **Status**: Working
- **Endpoint**: `http://localhost:3001/api/scrape`
- **Test Result**: 200 OK
- **Response**: `{strategy: "rss", contentLength: 2231}`

### ✅ Localhost Production Build (Port 3002)
- **Status**: Working
- **Endpoint**: `http://localhost:3002/api/scrape`
- **Test Result**: 200 OK
- **Response**: `{strategy: "rss", contentLength: 2231}`

### ⏳ Railway Deployment
- **Status**: Deployment in progress or failed
- **Endpoint**: `https://farcaster-miniapp-production.up.railway.app/api/scrape`
- **Current State**: Timing out (likely still deploying or crashed)

## Files Modified
1. `api/index.js` - Added scrape endpoint for Vercel/serverless deployments
2. `server/routes.js` - Added scrape endpoint for Railway/production deployments
3. `server/routes.ts` - Added debug logging
4. `server/index.ts` - Added route registration logging
5. `server/lib/extractor.d.ts` - Added `clearCache` type definition
6. `railway.json` - Created Railway configuration file

## Next Steps
1. **Check Railway Dashboard**: View deployment logs at https://railway.app/
2. **Wait for Deployment**: Railway may still be building/deploying (can take 2-5 minutes)
3. **Verify Endpoint**: Once deployed, test at:
