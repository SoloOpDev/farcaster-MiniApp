# Smart Contract - Final Status ✅

## 🎯 Changes Applied

### ✅ Fixed: Wallet-Hopping Attack
**Problem:** User could claim multiple times by switching wallets
**Solution:** FID is now locked to the first wallet used each day

```solidity
// Line 28: Added FID-to-wallet binding
mapping(uint256 => mapping(uint256 => address)) public fidWalletForDay;

// Lines 92-99: Enforce wallet binding
address registeredWallet = fidWalletForDay[fid][today];
if (registeredWallet == address(0)) {
    fidWalletForDay[fid][today] = msg.sender; // Lock FID to this wallet
} else {
    require(registeredWallet == msg.sender, "FID_BOUND_TO_DIFFERENT_WALLET");
}
```

### ✅ Updated: Daily Limit to 3 Claims
**Changed from:** 1 claim per day
**Changed to:** 3 claims per day (one per article)

```solidity
// Line 22: Updated daily limit
uint8 public constant DAILY_LIMIT = 3; // Three claims per day per FID

// Line 25: Track claim count instead of boolean
mapping(uint256 => mapping(uint256 => uint8)) public claimsUsedToday;

// Line 88: Check claim count
require(claimsUsedToday[fid][today] < DAILY_LIMIT, "DAILY_LIMIT_REACHED");

// Line 102: Increment counter
claimsUsedToday[fid][today]++;
```

### ✅ Added: Helper Function
```solidity
// Line 81-83: Get current claim count
function getClaimsUsedToday(uint256 fid) external view returns (uint8) {
    return claimsUsedToday[fid][_today()];
}
```

## 📊 How It Works Now

### User Flow (3 Claims Per Day)

**Day 1:**
1. User (FID 12345) opens Article #1 (index 0) with Wallet A
2. Reads for 10 seconds → Claims → Gets random token (e.g., CATCH)
3. Contract: `claimsUsedToday[12345][today] = 1` ✅
4. Contract: `fidWalletForDay[12345][today] = Wallet A` 🔒

5. User opens Article #2 (index 3) with **same Wallet A**
6. Claims → Gets random token (e.g., BOOP)
7. Contract: `claimsUsedToday[12345][today] = 2` ✅

8. User opens Article #3 (index 6) with **same Wallet A**
9. Claims → Gets random token (e.g., ARB)
10. Contract: `claimsUsedToday[12345][today] = 3` ✅

11. User tries to claim again → **REJECTED** (DAILY_LIMIT_REACHED)

**Day 2:**
- Counter resets (new day index)
- User can claim 3 more times
- Can use Wallet A or Wallet B (not locked anymore)

## 🔒 Security Features

### 1. Daily Limit Enforcement
```solidity
✅ Max 3 claims per FID per day
✅ Counter increments with each claim
✅ Resets automatically at midnight (UTC)
```

### 2. Wallet-Hopping Prevention
```solidity
✅ FID locked to first wallet used each day
✅ Cannot switch wallets mid-day
✅ Prevents multi-wallet exploitation
```

### 3. Token Distribution
```solidity
✅ Contract holds all tokens (no owner approval needed)
✅ Transfers directly from contract balance
✅ Checks balance before transfer
✅ Handles different token decimals automatically
```

### 4. Attack Vectors Closed
| Attack | Status | Protection |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Wallet-hopping | ✅ BLOCKED | FID-to-wallet binding |
| Double claiming | ✅ BLOCKED | Claim counter (max 3) |
| Wrong token type | ✅ BLOCKED | Validates tokenType ≤ 2 |
| Insufficient balance | ✅ BLOCKED | Checks contract balance |
| Unauthorized admin | ✅ BLOCKED | onlyOwner modifier |

## 📝 Contract Specifications

### Token Configuration
```solidity
// Token addresses (set in constructor)
catchToken = 0xbc4c97fb9befaa8b41448e1dfcc5236da543217f  // CATCH
boopToken  = 0x13A7DeDb7169a17bE92B0E3C7C2315B46f4772B3  // BOOP
arbToken   = 0x912CE59144191C1204E64559FE8253a0e49E6548  // ARB

// Reward amounts (adjustable by owner)
catchAmount = 5 CATCH      (5 * 10^18)
boopAmount  = 4000 BOOP    (4000 * 10^18)
arbAmount   = 0.001 ARB    (1 * 10^15)
```

### Daily Limit
```solidity
DAILY_LIMIT = 3 claims per FID per day
```

### Claim Logic
```solidity
1. Check: claimsUsedToday[fid][today] < 3
2. Check: tokenType is 0, 1, or 2
3. Check: FID is bound to msg.sender (or bind it)
4. Check: Token address is set
5. Check: Contract has enough balance
6. Transfer tokens to msg.sender
7. Increment claim counter
8. Emit TokensClaimed event
```

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [x] Daily limit set to 3
- [x] Wallet-hopping protection added
- [x] Transfer method correct (from contract)
- [x] Token addresses verified on Arbiscan
- [x] Decimal scaling implemented
- [x] Security checks in place

### Deploy Steps
1. [ ] Deploy contract to Arbitrum Mainnet with constructor args:
   ```
   _catch: 0xbc4c97fb9befaa8b41448e1dfcc5236da543217f
   _boop:  0x13A7DeDb7169a17bE92B0E3C7C2315B46f4772B3
   _arb:   0x912CE59144191C1204E64559FE8253a0e49E6548
   ```

2. [ ] Fund contract with tokens:
   ```
   Transfer CATCH to contract (e.g., 10,000 CATCH)
   Transfer BOOP to contract (e.g., 1,000,000 BOOP)
   Transfer ARB to contract (e.g., 10 ARB)
   ```

3. [ ] Update `.env`:
   ```bash
   VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x... # Your deployed contract address
   ```

4. [ ] Test on testnet first (recommended)
5. [ ] Verify contract on Arbiscan
6. [ ] Test claim flow end-to-end

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Scenario 1: Normal User (3 Claims)
```
Day 1:
- Claim 1 (Article 0): ✅ Success → Gets CATCH
- Claim 2 (Article 3): ✅ Success → Gets BOOP
- Claim 3 (Article 6): ✅ Success → Gets ARB
- Claim 4 (any):       ❌ Rejected (DAILY_LIMIT_REACHED)

Day 2:
- Claim 1: ✅ Success (counter reset)
```

### Scenario 2: Wallet-Hopping Attempt
```
Day 1:
- User claims with Wallet A: ✅ Success
- User switches to Wallet B: ❌ Rejected (FID_BOUND_TO_DIFFERENT_WALLET)

Day 2:
- User can use Wallet A or B: ✅ Success (new day, new binding)
```

### Scenario 3: Direct Contract Call (Bypass Frontend)
```
User calls contract directly:
- Backend checks bypassed ✅ (doesn't matter)
- Smart contract enforces all rules ✅
- Daily limit still enforced ✅
- Wallet binding still enforced ✅
```
