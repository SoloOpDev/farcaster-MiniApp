{"content":"<p>Brazil’s largest investment bank, BTG Pactual’s crypto platform Mynt, has flagged five cryptocurrencies it believes are well-positioned for gains in October: bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), solana (SOL), avalanche (AVAX), and sky (SKY).</p><p>The picks, outlined in <a href=\"https://assets.ctfassets.net/bfjfs7jy18xi/6lAQjOEz5IXDqAo6NXiacV/c3101e1d0539c21dad4efa6101ddd54e/Report.pdf\">a report</a> authored by Matheus Parizotto and João Galhardo, reflect a broader optimism in the crypto market as U.S. interest rates ease and anticipation builds for new crypto ETFs.</p><p>Bitcoin remains the dominant institutional pick, with more than $3.5 billion flowing into spot ETFs in September and corporate treasuries adding 43,000 BTC, over $5 billion at current prices.</p><p>Mynt’s report describes it as a long-term anchor. “For those seeking a long-term pillar in their portfolio, BTC offers liquidity, network security, and a track record of adoption that extends beyond retail investors,” it reads.</p><p>Ether, it says, continues to lead in on-chain finance. BTG Pactual’s team pointed out the network concentrates the majority of stablecoin volume and real-world asset tokenization projects.</p><p>Over the last six months, U.S. spot ETFs added $11.3 billion in ETH, while <a href=\"https://www.strategicethreserve.xyz/\">corporate treasuries</a> picked up 816,000 ETH in September alone. To the analysts, these flows show institutional appetite remains elevated.</p><h2>Beyond the top two</h2><p>Solana’s case hinges on speed and cost. The network, BTG Pactual pointed out, processed over $100 billion in <a href=\"https://defillama.com/chain/solana?dexsVolume=true&groupBy=monthly\">decentralized exchange (DEX) volume</a> for the third straight month, while its total value locked surpassed $30 billion for the first time in a sign of deepening DeFi liquidity.</p><p>The analysts added that institutional demand has been increasing with the potential arrival of new spot SOL ETFs, which could lead to greater flows and visibility.</p><p>“For those seeking exposure to high-performance infrastructure with growing adoption in real-world cases, Solana combines scale, competitive cost, and an accelerating network effect,” the report reads.</p><p>For AVAX, BTG Pactual highlighted its sharp growth in on-chain activity, noting that daily transactions increased by 46% and stablecoin transfers rose by 421% over the last quarter.</p><p>The network’s subnet architecture allows enterprises to spin up custom blockchains, boosting real-world use cases, it said.</p><p>Sky Protocol, the rebranded MakerDAO, rounds out the list. Its stablecoin, USDS, has a circulating supply of nearly $8 billion, and its Sky Savings Rate offers a variable return that’s currently at 4.75%.</p><p>Coupled with a token buyback program that’s already deployed $77 million, the report is positioning SKY as a revenue-generating DeFi token with long-term potential.</p>","contentLength":2943,"strategy":"rss"}
