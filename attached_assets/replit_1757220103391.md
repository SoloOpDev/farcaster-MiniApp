## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built using React with TypeScript and follows a component-based architecture:

- **Framework**: React 18 with Vite as the build tool and development server
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and caching
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a custom Arbitrum-inspired dark theme using CSS variables
- **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design with specific mobile breakpoints and Farcaster miniapp constraints

### Backend Architecture
The backend follows a RESTful API design with Express.js:

- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints for news articles and user token claims
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL session store
- **Development**: Hot module replacement with Vite middleware integration

### Data Storage Solutions
The application uses a hybrid storage approach:

- **Production Database**: PostgreSQL hosted on Neon Database with connection pooling
- **Development Storage**: In-memory storage implementation for rapid development
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM provides type-safe database queries and automatic TypeScript type generation
- **Schema Management**: Database migrations handled through Drizzle Kit
- **Session Store**: PostgreSQL-backed session storage using connect-pg-simple

### Authentication and Authorization
The app integrates with Farcaster's social authentication system:

- **Farcaster Integration**: Uses Farcaster SDK for user authentication and wallet connection
- **Wallet-based Identity**: User identification through Ethereum wallet addresses
- **Mock Development**: Development environment includes mock user data for testing
- **Token Claims**: Daily claim limits (3 tokens per day) enforced at the API level
