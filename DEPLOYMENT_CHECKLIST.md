# Farcaster Mini App Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ Code Fixes Applied

- [x] Fixed Wagmi connector to use `farcasterMiniApp()` from `@farcaster/miniapp-wagmi-connector`
- [x] Fixed Farcaster SDK initialization to use `await sdk.actions.ready()` and `await sdk.context`
- [x] Removed wallet address display from UI (Farcaster handles this automatically)
- [x] Content loads immediately while Farcaster connects in background
- [x] Removed "read 3 articles to unlock" logic - only 3 specific articles (indices 0, 3, 6) have rewards
- [x] Fixed date parsing error with validation

## üöÄ Pre-Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Variables
Ensure you have set:
```bash
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<your-deployed-contract-address>
```

### 2. Build the App
```bash
npm run build
```

### 3. Deploy to HTTPS Endpoint
Mini Apps **MUST** be served over HTTPS. Options:
- Vercel
- Netlify
- Railway
- Your own server with SSL

### 4. Enable Developer Mode in Farcaster
1. Visit: https://farcaster.xyz/~/settings/developer-tools
2. Toggle on "Developer Mode"
3. Access developer tools from left sidebar (desktop)

### 5. Create Mini App Manifest
In Farcaster Developer Tools:
- **Name**: Crypto News - Learn & Earn
- **URL**: Your HTTPS deployment URL
- **Description**: Read crypto news and earn tokens on Arbitrum
- **Icon**: Upload app icon (512x512 recommended)

### 6. Test in Farcaster
- Open your Mini App in Farcaster mobile app
- Open your Mini App in Farcaster desktop app
- Verify FID is retrieved correctly
- Test wallet auto-connection
- Test reading articles
- Test claiming tokens on rewardable articles (indices 0, 3, 6)

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First Time User
1. User opens Mini App in Farcaster
2. ‚úÖ Content loads immediately
3. ‚úÖ Farcaster connects in background (small blue indicator shows)
4. ‚úÖ FID is retrieved automatically
5. ‚úÖ Wallet auto-connects (no manual connection needed)
6. User opens article at index 0, 3, or 6
7. ‚úÖ 10-second timer starts
8. ‚úÖ After timer, "Claim" button becomes active
9. User clicks "Claim"
10. ‚úÖ Transaction prompt appears in their wallet
11. ‚úÖ User approves transaction
12. ‚úÖ Tokens are sent to their wallet
13. ‚úÖ "Tokens Claimed!" message appears

### Scenario 2: Non-Rewardable Article
1. User opens article at index 1, 2, 4, 5, etc.
2. ‚úÖ Content loads normally
3. ‚úÖ No claim button appears (just reading experience)

### Scenario 3: Already Claimed Today
1. User who already claimed 3 times today opens rewardable article
2. ‚úÖ "Tokens Claimed!" message shows
3. ‚úÖ "Come back tomorrow for more rewards" message

## üìä Key Metrics to Monitor

- **FID Retrieval Rate**: % of users where FID is successfully retrieved
- **Wallet Connection Rate**: % of users successfully connected
- **Claim Success Rate**: % of claim attempts that succeed
- **Transaction Failures**: Monitor for network/gas issues
- **Article Read Rate**: Which articles get the most engagement

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: FID not retrieved
**Solution**: Check console logs. In production, SDK should work. In development, mock FID (12345) is used.

### Issue: Wallet not connecting
**Solution**: Ensure user has a connected wallet in Farcaster settings. The connector auto-connects to their preferred wallet.

### Issue: Transaction fails
**Solution**: 
- Check user has enough ETH for gas on Arbitrum
- Verify contract address is correct
- Check contract has enough tokens to distribute

### Issue: "Not on Arbitrum" error
**Solution**: App auto-switches to Arbitrum. If it fails, user needs to manually switch in their wallet.

### Issue: Date parsing error
**Solution**: Already fixed with validation. If article has invalid date, timestamp won't show (no error).

## üîê Security Checklist

- [x] Contract address stored in environment variable (not hardcoded)
- [x] User FID from SDK is used for claims (not client-side input)
- [x] Backend validates claims before recording
- [x] Daily limit enforced (3 claims per day per FID)
- [x] Only specific articles (indices 0, 3, 6) are rewardable
- [x] 10-second timer prevents instant claims

## üì± Mobile Optimization

- [x] Max width: 420px (Farcaster frame width)
- [x] Touch-friendly buttons (min 44px height)
- [x] Fast loading (content shows immediately)
- [x] Responsive images
- [x] Smooth scrolling

## üé® UI/UX Verification

- [x] No wallet address shown (Farcaster handles this)
- [x] Content loads immediately (no blocking on auth)
- [x] Subtle "Connecting Farcaster..." indicator (non-intrusive)
- [x] Clear claim button on rewardable articles
- [x] Timer shows countdown (10 seconds)
- [x] Success message after claim
- [x] Dark mode support
