The potential resistance is defined by the trendline connecting the July 15 and Aug. 14 highs.</p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4cef97f890def2694de9582638db22910a534d88-2854x1344.png?auto=format\" alt=\"BTC's daily price chart in candlesticks format. (CoinDesk)\" title=\"BTC's expanding price range. (CoinDesk)\" /><p>A reversal from this level could trigger a corrective pullback down toward the lower boundary of the range, represented by the trendline drawn from the Aug. 3 and Sept. 1 lows.</p><h2>$135,000</h2><p>A breakout from the expanding range would shift focus to $135,000, where market makers currently hold a net long gamma position, according to activity in Deribit-listed options tracked by Amberdata.  </p><p>When market makers are net long gamma, they tend to trade against the market direction – buying on dips and selling on rallies – to maintain their overall market-neutral exposure. Other things being equal, this hedging activity tends to dampen price volatility.</p><p>In other words, the $135,000 level could act as a resistance on the way higher.</p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c59ee071bb0fbda1006e7dae3285c6b49a65bf78-1489x1057.png?auto=format\" alt=\" Distribution of delaer/market maker gamma. (Amberdata)\" title=\"BTC options on Deribit: Distribution of delaer/market maker gamma. (Amberdata)\" /><h2>$140,000</h2><p>Lastly, $140,000 stands out as key level, as data from Deribit shows the $140,000 strike call is the second-most popular on the exchange, holding a notional open interest of over $2 billion.</p><p>Notional open interest refers to the dollar value of the number of active or open options contracts at a given time.</p><p>Levels with large concentrations of open interest often act as magnets, drawing the price of the underlying asset toward them. A high open interest in call options suggests that many traders expect the spot price to approach or top that level.</p><p>At the same time, those who have sold these calls, often large institutions, have an incentive to keep the price below that strike. Their hedging and trading activity around that level can create resistance, making it harder for the price to break through.</p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/753fd369680407a631505c72c165ac3f70468430-2589x1056.png?auto=format\" alt=\"Distribution of open interest in Deribit-listed BTC options.

Hougan added that this narrative resonates strongly with investors who understand the scale of change such technologies could bring.</p><p>Hougan said that once audiences begin to consider how to gain exposure to blockchain, comparisons between platforms inevitably follow. In that evaluation, he argued, Solana’s combination of speed, throughput and near-instant finality makes it “extraordinarily attractive.” </p><p>He cited improvements from 400 microseconds to 150 microseconds in settlement speed, describing the feature as intuitive for those accustomed to trading environments where execution and latency are critical.</p><p>Framing Solana as “the new Wall Street,” Hougan said the blockchain’s technical edge is resonating with market participants. He said the narrative is “really resonant” and added that “you’ll see substantial flows.”</p><h3>Technical Analysis of SOL&#x27;s Price Action</h3><p>According to CoinDesk Research&#x27;s technical analysis data model, during the 23-hour session from Oct. 3 at 15:00 UTC to Oct. 4 at 14:00 UTC, SOL traded within a narrow $8.40 range between $228.19 and $237.04, reflecting a period of consolidation. </p><p>The high was set at $237.04 around 16:00 on Oct. 3 before steady selling pressure pushed the price lower toward the $228–$229 area, which acted as support.</p><p>Trading activity was strongest early in the session, with volumes peaking at 3.29 million units around 17:00, but gradually declined to just 42,637 by the closing hour of the analysis period. This sharp reduction in volume suggested weakening participation and a potential pause before a larger directional move.</p><p>In the final 60 minutes, from 13:11 to 14:10 UTC on Oct. 4, SOL broke below the established $228–$229 support zone. Prices fell from $229.84 to $228.94, a 0.39% drop that confirmed the bearish shift. </p><p>Within this window, the market showed two phases: an early rebound attempt that briefly lifted the price to $229.78 at 13:38, followed by renewed selling that drove the token down to $228.72.</p><p>Importantly, this breakdown coincided with a surge in volume. The single busiest minute occurred at 14:01, when 18,011 units traded — the highest one-minute reading of the session. </p><p>This pattern of falling price alongside rising volume suggested larger sellers were active, potentially increasing the likelihood that bearish momentum continues.</p><p></p><p><strong><em>Disclaimer:</em></strong> <em>Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to</em> <em><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/ethics\">our standards</a>.

The Securities and Exchange Commission was expected to allow ETFs tracking the prices of assets like Solana (SOL) and Litecoin (LTC) to launch this past week. While there was some movement last week and Monday, the clock ran out before all of the final paperwork could be pushed through, and the issuers <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/30/here-s-what-happens-to-solana-litecoin-etfs-if-the-u-s-shuts-down\">have not yet been able to launch</a>.</p><p></p><p>The SEC was <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/09/30/u-s-sec-takes-preliminary-step-to-expand-universe-of-crypto-custody-to-state-trusts\">able to finalize</a> a pair of <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/news-analysis/2025/09/30/sec-s-bow-to-doublezero-carries-major-weight-for-decentralized-infrastructure-peirce\">no-action letters</a> prior to the shutdown as well.

BTG Pactual’s team pointed out the network concentrates the majority of stablecoin volume and real-world asset tokenization projects.</p><p>Over the last six months, U.S. spot ETFs added $11.3 billion in ETH, while <a href=\"https://www.strategicethreserve.xyz/\">corporate treasuries</a> picked up 816,000 ETH in September alone.

A kind of “super app” for spending, saving, and investing.</p><p>Yet, calling MB a “super app” may not quite capture the essence of the strategy. Its leadership prefers a different term: a financial hub that blends legacy finance with blockchain, letting users tap into both without needing to understand either.</p><p>“The revolution happens when the protocol disappears,” Cunha told CoinDesk. “The customer doesn’t want to hear about blockchains and tokens. They want to know the rate, the risk, and the maturity date,” he said, referring to the exchange’s tokenized fixed income offerings.</p><h2>&#x27;Invisible blockchain&#x27;</h2><p>That thinking has reshaped how MB presents itself to users. Instead of relying on crypto-native vocabulary, the company now emphasizes features in its offering. One major change involved scrapping the term “tokenization” in user-facing materials altogether, Cunha said.</p><p>“We tried a ton of variations,” Cunha said. “When we stopped saying ‘token’ and started saying ‘digital fixed income,’ things took off.” The idea is to have a product whose backend is powered by blockchain technology, but the frontend remains more recognizable to the masses. </p><p>Essentially, MB’s bet is that “invisible blockchain” is the next frontier.</p><p>“We’re going to see a lot of people use blockchain without realizing they’re using blockchain,” MB said. “That’s when you know the revolution has happened.”</p><p>The firm’s flagship blockchain-based investment products focus on tokenized private credit, a segment it believes is underserved and ripe for disruption in Brazil. </p><p>Brazil ranks among the top five countries for retail crypto usage, according to Chainalysis’ <a href=\"https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2025-global-crypto-adoption-index/\">Global Crypto Adoption Index</a>. MB is positioning itself as an answer to a pain point common in the country through a stablecoin-based remittance service.</p><h2>A pivot from trading</h2><p>Despite all the new initiatives, MB’s core business, crypto trading, still accounts for the majority of its revenue. But that balance is shifting.</p><p>At its peak, trading made up 95% of the firm’s income. Today, that number is closer to 60%, with the rest coming from payments, custody, tokenized investments, and services like asset management. Over time, the company expects trading to fall below 30%, Cunha revealed.</p><p>As part of that shift, the firm is also expanding geographically. It now has a client-facing operation in Portugal and is building institutional channels in the U.S., aiming to link capital and investment opportunities across markets.</p><p>Mercado Bitcoin, where a significant portion of assets under management are <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/09/27/corporate-clients-hold-up-to-15-of-assets-on-mercado-bitcoin-exchange-exec-says\">made up of small and medium enterprises’ treasuries</a>, expects to surpass 3 billion reais ($563 million) in tokenized credit issuance by year-end. About 20% of assets under custody on the platform are now tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), up from virtually zero just a few years ago.</p><p>The pivot sits within a wider push to build “financial super apps.” Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has said Coinbase aims to be a <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/20/coinbase-ceo-we-want-to-become-a-super-app-and-provide-all-types-of-financial-services\">crypto-powered “super app” </a>that would provide “all types of financial services.”</p><p>Beyond crypto, fintechs such as Revolut and Paytm are bundling payments, lending and investing. The playbook borrows from WeChat and Alipay, apps that bundle social, financial, and other features.</p><p><strong><em>Read more: <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/07/07/crypto-exchange-mercado-bitcoin-to-tokenize-usd200m-in-real-world-assets-on-xrp-ledger\">Crypto Exchange Mercado Bitcoin to Tokenize $200M in Real-World Assets on XRP Ledger</a></em></strong></p>","sourceTitle":"CoinDesk","sourceDomain":"coindesk.com","publishedAt":"2025-10-04T14:00:00.000Z","createdAt":"2025-10-05T08:09:11.473Z","image":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d756d0268c596d7d4022a1fb4c3fddeb43dca8a7-1500x1000.jpg?auto=format&w=1920&h=1080&crop=focalpoint&fit=clip","originalUrl":"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/10/04/brazil-s-mercado-bitcoin-bets-on-invisible-blockchain-approach-to-build-financial-super-app","kind":"article","author":"Francisco Rodrigues"}]}
