# Wallet Binding Debug Improvements

## Changes Made

Added comprehensive debugging and user warnings for the FID-to-wallet binding issue.

### 1. Enhanced Console Logging

**Before claiming** (lines 344-347):
```typescript
console.log('📝 Claiming with contract:', CONTRACT_ADDRESS);
console.log('📝 FID:', fid);
console.log('📝 Connected Wallet Address:', address);
console.log('📝 Bound Wallet from Contract:', boundWallet);
```

This helps debug which wallet addresses are being compared.

### 2. Visual Warning Banner

Added a prominent warning that shows BEFORE the user tries to claim (lines 871-880):

```typescript
{boundWallet && address && boundWallet.toLowerCase() !== address.toLowerCase() && (
  <div className="mt-3 text-sm bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 text-amber-800 dark:text-amber-300 border border-amber-300 dark:border-amber-700 rounded-lg p-3">
    <div className="font-semibold mb-1">⚠️ Wallet Mismatch Detected</div>
    <div className="text-xs space-y-1">
      <div>Your FID is bound to: <span className="font-mono">{boundWallet.slice(0,6)}...{boundWallet.slice(-4)}</span></div>
      <div>Currently connected: <span className="font-mono">{address.slice(0,6)}...{address.slice(-4)}</span></div>
      <div className="mt-2 text-amber-700 dark:text-amber-400">You must use the bound wallet to claim, or wait until tomorrow to use a different wallet.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

### 3. Detailed Error Message

Enhanced error message to show exact wallet addresses (line 491):

```typescript
errorMsg = `Your FID is bound to a different wallet today. Connected: ${address?.slice(0,6)}...${address?.slice(-4)} | Bound: ${boundWallet ? (boundWallet as string).slice(0,6) + '...' + (boundWallet as string).slice(-4) : 'Unknown'}. Please use the same wallet or wait until tomorrow.`;
```

## How to Debug Your Issue

1. **Open browser console** (F12) on mobile
2. **Look for the debug logs** when you load the article page:
   ```
   🔍 DEBUG FID-WALLET BINDING:
     Your FID: [your FID]
     Connected Wallet: 0x93Fa...637F
     Bound Wallet from contract: [bound address]
     Addresses Match?: true/false
   ```

3. **Check the warning banner** - if wallets don't match, you'll see:
   - Which wallet your FID is bound to
   - Which wallet is currently connected
   
4. **When you try to claim**, check console for:
   ```
   📝 Claiming with contract: [address]
   📝 FID: [your FID]
   📝 Connected Wallet Address: [current wallet]
   📝 Bound Wallet from Contract: [bound wallet]
   ```

## Possible Causes of Your Issue

Since you're using the same Farcaster account and same verified wallet, the issue might be:

1. **Farcaster mobile app using different wallet** - Even though `0x93Fa...637F` is verified, the app might be signing transactions with the Farcaster Wallet instead
2. **Wallet not properly connected** - The app might not be using your verified wallet for transactions
3. **Different wallet was used for first claim** - Check the bound wallet address in the debug logs

## Next Steps

1. Deploy these changes
2. Try to claim on mobile
3. Check the console logs and warning banner
4. Share the exact wallet addresses shown in the debug output

This will tell us EXACTLY which two wallets are being compared and why they don't match.
